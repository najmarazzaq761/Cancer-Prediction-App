# Cancer Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting cancer using machine learning models. The app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for making cancer predictions based on various input features.

## Overview

The Cancer Prediction App leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cancer based on user-provided input data. The application is built using Streamlit, which allows for the creation of interactive and visually appealing web applications with minimal code.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input various features related to cancer prediction.
- **Real-time Predictions**: The app provides real-time predictions based on the input features.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visual representations of the input data and prediction results.
- **Model Interpretability**: Insights into how different features contribute to the prediction.

## Installation

To run the Cancer Prediction App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/najmarazzaq/Cancer-Prediction-App.git
   cd Cancer-Prediction-App
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run 02_cancer_prediction_app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Cancer Prediction App. Enter the required input features and click the "Predict" button to get the prediction results.
